Project Name: Library Management System - Database Design

Description:
This project provides a complete database design for a Library Management System, including three essential database models:

Conceptual Model (ER Diagram) – Represents entities, relationships, and key attributes.
Logical Model – Converts the conceptual design into tables, columns, primary keys, and foreign keys.
Physical Model – Defines database-specific implementations, including data types, constraints, and indexing.
The system is designed to track books, members, loans, and publishers, ensuring efficient book borrowing, member management, and reporting functionalities.

Features:
✔ Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
✔ Normalized Database Schema (3NF)
✔ SQL-Compatible Table Structures
✔ Foreign Key Constraints for Data Integrity
✔ Indexing for Performance Optimization

Tools Used:
Diagramming: Draw.io
Database Management Systems (DBMS): MySQL
